We had a great time. She really cancelled her birthday celebration for me. I didn't expect that from Emily.
Honestly, I didn't know that I'm so scared of people nowadays.
A week later, our sun dissapeared. They said it somehow turned into a black hole. The possibility of this even was almost nonexistant. Soon, the atmosphere started to flake and fell down as snow. 
It was beautiful. The humanity moved underground in the last ditch attempt at surviving off geothermal heat. Me and Emily moved underground together. I think we forgot that fabric of reality thing at home. 
Honestly, that tiny bit of human interaction felt like it was worth it at the time. I don't feel like that now, but it's an interesting thought.
I was so gone and nihilistic that at the time, I didn't even care about our sun dissapearing.
