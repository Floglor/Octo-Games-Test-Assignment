My head hurts. 
I worked too much last night. Well, it was already morning when I woke up. I think.

Sometimes, I forget my name. What was it?

MC: It's Saturday, and it's getting late already. Just how long did I speep?
Yog: You're finally awake. You slept for quite a while.

The familiar, pleasant feminine voice is buzzing in my head. 
I feel like I need to explain something. Yog is my friend. I don't know how exactly that works...
...but when I found an old book in a public library, and read it, the voice spoke to me.
Perhaps nobody found it before me because nobody uses paper anymore. That library was abandoned long time ago.
Maybe, I'm just going insane. But I can see those weird golden bubbles around when I'm talking to her. And also, she doesn't always follow me.
MC: Good morning. Yes, sorry, I was sleeping.
Yog: I have a Quest for you. 
MC: What are you, some kind of NPC?
Yog: What is an NPC?
MC: Nevermind. You never asked me to do anything before. What do you need? 
Yog: There is one item... of great value for me. I want you to get it. It's really, really important. 
MC: Wow. What is it?
I'm starting to question if I really see things.
Yog: It doesn't matter, darling! What matters that it is very precious for me. If you do this... I might show you something. 
MC: Wow. What are you going to show me?
@char Yog.Flushed
Yog: That's a secret <3
MC: You're exeptionally cryptic today. 
@char Yog.Neutral
Yog: You always call me that. 
MC: Come on, you did't even tell me what you are. Nevermind. Where is it?
Yog: I think there is a place called "The Bottom" or something. It's in the Downtown.
MC: Oh, "The Bottom"? That's where Emily works.
Yog: <size=60%>Oh, that bitch.
MC: What?
Yog: Nevermind, darling, I want you to go there, and take it. Someone has it already, but it seems they don't need it much. I mean, someone has the means of obtaining it.  
MC: What do you mean?
@char Yog.Angry
Yog: Just go there and do something!
MC: Ugh.


I guess I have to go now.

The year of 2079 wasn't really good for the corporations. I heard that leftover Eastern Europe countries that corps avoid like fire are again at war. 
Most people cope with the recession by using Neural Implant AI-VR technologies. They offer limitless AI creativity with the small side effect of losing your humanity.
Your brain rewires so you don't see difference with AI creations and reality. It's a feature of GPT-510 and it provides a layer of authenticity. 
That's why I'm not surprised about seeing things.
