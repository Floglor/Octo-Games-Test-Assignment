MC: My head hurts.  
I worked too much last night. Well, it was already morning when I woke up. I think.

MC: Sometimes, I forget my name. What was it?

MC: It's Saturday, and it's already late. Just how long did I sleep?

Yog: You're finally awake. You slept for quite a while.

@char Yog.Neutral
The familiar, pleasant feminine voice buzzes in my head.  
I feel like I need to explain something. Yog is my friend. I don't know exactly how that works...

...but when I found an old book in a public library and read it, the voice spoke to me.  
Maybe nobody found it before me because nobody uses paper anymore. That library was abandoned a long time ago.  
Maybe I'm just going insane. But I see these weird golden bubbles when I talk to her. And she doesn’t always follow me.

MC: Good morning. Yeah, sorry, I was asleep.

Yog: I have a quest for you.

MC: What are you, some kind of NPC?

Yog: What is an NPC?

MC: Nevermind. You’ve never asked me to do anything before. What do you need?

Yog: There is an item... of great value to me. I want you to get it. It's really, really important.
@showUI QuestLog

MC: Wow. What is it?  
I'm starting to question if I’m really seeing things.

Yog: It doesn't matter, darling! What matters is that it's very precious to me. If you do this... I might show you something.

MC: Wow. What are you going to show me?

@char Yog.Flushed
Yog: That's a secret. <3

MC: You're exceptionally cryptic today.

@char Yog.Neutral
Yog: You always say that.

MC: Come on, you haven't even told me what you are. Nevermind. Where is it?

Yog: I think there's a place called "The Bottom" or something. It's in Downtown.

MC: Oh, "The Bottom"? That's where Emily works.

Yog: <size=60%>Oh, that bitch.

MC: What?

Yog: Nevermind, darling. I want you to go there and take it. Someone already has it, but it seems like they don't need it much. I mean, they have the means of obtaining it.

MC: What do you mean?

@char Yog.Angry
Yog: Just go there and do something!

MC: Ugh.

I guess I have to go now.

MC: The year 2079 wasn't great for the corporations.  
I heard the leftover Eastern European countries that the corps avoid like the plague are at war again.  
Most people cope with the recession by using Neural Implant AI-VR technologies.  
They offer limitless AI creativity, with the small side effect of losing your humanity.  
Your brain rewires so you can’t tell the difference between AI creations and reality. It's a feature of GPT-510, and it adds a layer of authenticity.  
That’s why I'm not surprised I’m seeing things.
